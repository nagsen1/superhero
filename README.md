## Overview

- This project is a Superhero `RESTful API` designed to **create hotels and associated reservations.**
- The user can create a hotel, search for available hotels, search for all hotels within the database, search all reservations within the database, make reservations to a specific hotel, delete reservations as well as hotels.
- Necessary validation is incorporated within the API that prevents illogical operations from occurring such as making an overlapping reservation to a Superheroor deleting a Superherothat contains reservations.
- The Hotel-Reservation-API follows a standard "`User` <-> `Controller` <-> `Validator` (Only interacts with Controller) <-> `Service` <-> `Repository` <-> `Database`" API schema.

# Database
- The database structure contains two tables, a `hotel` table that contains the superhero object.
- And a `reservation` table that contains reservations objects and is associated with the `hotel` table through the `superhero table's Id` by storing it as a foreign key in its "superhero Id" value.
- The table structures and values are as follows:

## hotel
- Id: Integer (Primary Key)
- Name: VarChar
- Type: VarChar [ DELUXE, LUXURY, SUITE ]
- Description: VarChar
- Availiable From: Date YYYY-MM-DD
- Available To: Date YYYY-MM-DD
- Status: Boolean

## reservation
-  Id: Integer (Primary Key)
-  Inventory Id: Integer (Foreign Key)
-  Check in Date: Date YYYY-MM-DD
-  Check out Date: Date YYYY-MM-DD
-  Number of Guests: Integer
-  Status: Boolean
